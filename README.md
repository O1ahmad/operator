=========

in·fra·struc·ture/ˈinfrəˌstrək(t)SHər/

    1. the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.

*O1 Labs is an open, decentralized and managed infrastructure/operations service provider dedicated to the development, provisioning and support of ALL things cloud-native and cryptography.*

We believe infrastructure forms the "floor" on which a society stands and, as such, sets the barrier to accessing vital or valuable services within. Software infrastructure is no exception. Championing fundamental DevOps principles and an automate-everything approach, the goal of O1 is to lower or remove the barriers blocking access for users to the incredible landscape of the world's most powerful tools and open-source projects.

Leveraging the collective expertise and insights of world-wide communities committed to their cause, each managed service is designed, developed and optimized to meet (or surpass) a standard of production-readiness or a measure of how well an infrastructure supports the following core tenets:
* usability
* resiliency
* observability
* security
